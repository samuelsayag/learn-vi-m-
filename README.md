Vi and Vim notes
================

Concept
-------
Vi is loading the file in edition into a buffer - a copy of the file.

Vi consider this different state of editing: 

	*  insert
	*  change
	*  delete
	*  move
	*  copy

Edit a text with Vi
-------------------

`$ vi [filename]`

Leave Vi without writing to the buffer
--------------------------------------

Type: `:q!`
